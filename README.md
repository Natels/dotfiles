# Personal dotfiles

## What is this repo?

This repo contains my personal ["dotfiles"]. In other words, the configuration
files for my terminal, shell, prompt, macOS, and other software.

## Features

- Semi-automated [installation]
- [macOS] customizations
- [Homebrew] for apps and packages
- [Prezto] for `zsh` customization
- [Powerlevel10k] for prompt customization
- [iTerm] customization
- [1Password] integration for `ssh`
- [Git] customizations, including signing with SSH
- [Touch ID] for `sudo`
- Can be extended with other (potentially private) dotfiles repos

## Installation

> ⚠️ This repo is not intended for installation by anyone other than myself. It
> makes a lot of assumptions about software that I use, and will not work for
> anyone else without heavy modification.

bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natels/dotfiles/main/install)
